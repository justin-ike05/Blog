           <article><h2> Electric Cars Are Taking Over </h2>
            <p> Electric vehicles (EVs) are more popular than ever, and 2024 is no different. 
                Cars Include: <ul><li>Telsa Model 3</li>
                                    <li>Ford Mustang Mach-E</li>
                                    <li> Chevrolet Bolt EV</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    These cars are making waves.Not only are they fast and fun to drive, but they're also better for the environment. Plus, many governments offer tax credits to make owning one cheaper!</p>
                                    <h2>Self-Driving Tech Is Getting Smarter</h2>
                                    <p>While we're not quite at the stage of fully autonomous cars, 2024 brings more advanced driver-assistance features. Cars like the <strong>Tesla Model S</strong> and <strong>BMW iX </strong> come with better autopilot systems that can help with highway driving, parking, and even avoid accidents. Just don't take your hands off the wheel just yet!</p>
                                    <h2>Compact SUVs for the Win</h2>
                                    <p>Compact SUVs are becoming a favorite for young drivers because they offer a perfect mix of size, style, and versatility. Models like the <strong>Toyota Corolla Cross</strong>, <strong>CX-30</strong>, and <strong>Honda HR-V</strong> are easy to drive, fit plenty of gear, and look super stylish.</p>
                                    <h2>Eco-Friendly Hybrids Are Cool Too</h2>
                                    <p>Not ready to go fully electric? Hybrids are a great middle ground. Cars like the <strong>Prius</strong> and <strong>CR-V Hybrid</strong> combine gas and electric power to save fuel and reduce emissions. They're great for young drivers who want to save on gas but aren't ready for an all-electric lifestyle.</p>
                                    <h2>Affordable Tech Features</h2>
                                    <p>The coolest thing about 2024 cars? Even the affordable ones come packed with technology.</p>
